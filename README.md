# Summary

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) Tool.

The tool reads an OpenAPI Schema file and generates the stubs to use the respective methods.

The tool can run as a container to easier support use in distributed environments.

# What next...

This was written as a _proof of concept_. 

It'll be tidied up at some point... I'd like to move it all to a `Class`.

Feel free to plagiarise... just keep to the licensing terms.
